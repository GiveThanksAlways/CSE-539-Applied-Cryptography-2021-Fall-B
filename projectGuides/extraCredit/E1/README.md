# E1 - Extra credit 1%

* This first extra credit assignment is worth 1% (1% added to your total grade)

## Instructions

1 - Download the Signal app on your phone ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669))
> (email me if you do not have access to an android or iOS device and I will allow you to submit the extra credit another way)

2 - Find a principle or concept that we learn about in this class that is used in the Signal app 
> (This is meant to be very simple, I just want you guys to connect something from the class to a real world end-to-end encryption app. Look at the [Signal documentation](https://signal.org/docs/) or watch this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/DXv1boalsDI) to help find a principle)

3 - Send a one sentence message of that principle or concept to the class signal account at this number: `+1 480-442-2419` (Google Voice phone number created for the class)
> (just message one sentence about a connection you saw. I am only grading on participation but please don't send something basic like "it uses encryption" haha)

4 - Send a message with your ASU email so I can enter in your extra credit on Canvas. 
> (I will be deleting the class Signal account and the google voice number once the class is over so no phone numbers/ emails will be saved)
